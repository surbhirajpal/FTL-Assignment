# FTL-Assignment

Here is a FTL frontend assignment.
As it was asked to create a mock API using the JSON data provided, I created mock API through www.mockapi.io - https://5f522d837c47c30016e301c0.mockapi.io/Data2
I have used this api to fetch data and display it in the application.

To extract the project following commands needs to be run

- git clone https://github.com/surbhirajpal/FTL-Assignment.git
- cd FTL-Assignment
- cd my-app
- npm i
- npm start
